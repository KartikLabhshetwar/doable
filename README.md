## Architecture

### Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The main entities are:

- **Team** - Top-level workspace organization
- **Project** - Project containers within teams
- **Issue** - Task items with priority, status, and estimates
- **WorkflowState** - Custom workflow states (backlog, todo, in progress, etc.)
- **Label** - Categorization tags for issues
- **TeamMember** - User-team relationships with roles
- **Invitation** - Pending team invitations via email
- **ChatConversation** - AI chatbot conversation history
- **ChatMessage** - Individual messages in conversations

### API Routes

- `/api/auth/*` - Better Auth authentication handlers
- `/api/teams/*` - Team management and CRUD operations
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/issues/*` - Issue management
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/projects/*` - Project management
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/chat` - AI chatbot endpoint with streaming
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/invitations/*` - Team invitation system
- `/api/invitations/[invitationId]` - Public invitation details

### AI Chatbot

The chatbot is powered by Vercel AI SDK with Groq using the GPT-OSS (Open Source GPT) 120B model. It uses function calling for:

- **Creating and updating issues** - Natural language task creation with automatic field resolution
- **Managing projects** - Create, update, and manage project containers
- **Inviting team members** - Send team invitations via email
- **Retrieving team statistics** - Get overview of team activity and metrics
- **Listing and filtering issues** - Query and display tasks with various filters
- **Getting issue details** - Retrieve complete information about specific tasks

**Key Features:**

- Natural language understanding for project management commands
- Automatic resolution of names to IDs (workflow states, assignees, projects, labels)
- Multi-step tool execution capability
- Conversation history persistence in database
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Team-specific API key support (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key)

Chat history is persisted in the database for each conversation, allowing users to resume previous discussions.
